## 1 ‧ Why a Mobile‑App Engineer Went Back to “Game Dev 101”

Even after shipping **DoneTodo**, I felt a gap:

1. **Systems‑level fun‑engineering.** Games are the pinnacle of engagement loops—perfect sandboxes for practicing retention mechanics without dark UX.
2. **Rapid cross‑platform prototyping.** Console‑to‑mobile thinking forces ruthless performance trade‑offs that transfer directly to Flutter and React Native.
3. **Team orchestration at indie scale.** I juggle designer, PM, and full‑stack hats daily; formal methods for mock‑ups, milestones, and test releases sounded like free steroids.

So I enrolled in LA County Library’s instructor‑facilitated **_How to Get Started in Game Development_**.

## 2 ‧ Micro‑Wins From Each Lesson

| Lesson & Focus                          | Hard Skill I Added                                                                              | How I’ll Exploit It in My Apps                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1 • Industry Primer**                | Benchmarked genre budgets & revenue ladders.                                                    | Build data‑driven ROI models before green‑lighting side projects.                                                |
| **L2 • Genres · Platforms · Audiences** | Segmented nine core genres & mapped them to device affordances.                                 | Re‑frame onboarding screens using genre expectations (e.g., progress bars ≈ RPG XP).                             |
| **L3 • Interface Design**               | Designed feedback ↔ control loops; built greyscale mock‑ups in 30 min.                         | Convert Figma comps to tappable prototypes before any SwiftUI code touches Git.                                  |
| **L4 • Immersion & Fun**                | Deconstructed Prensky’s _12 Elements of Fun_.                                                   | Stress‑test new features against **“CCCO”** (Conflict‑Competition‑Challenge‑Opposition) before backlog grooming. |
| **L5 • Production Planning**            | Scoped 13 studio roles; drafted lean staffing matrix (artist + dev + PM + QA).                  | Formalize contributor agreements for future contract collaborators.                                              |
| **L6 • Toolchains**                     | Evaluated Unity, Unreal, Xcode, Android Studio—bench‑marked build times & asset pipelines.      | Choose **Unity + Addressables** for 2‑week AR prototype; reuse CI/CD scripts from iOS builds.                    |
| **L7 • Team Leadership (Pt 1)**         | Implemented remote stand‑ups, async status docs, and project prefix tags (`[AppName] Subject`). | Halved Slack noise in my freelance squads; Jenkins jobs auto‑label by prefix.                                    |
| **L8 • Processes & Testing (Pt 2)**     | Wrote pseudocode first, code second; locked “Alpha → Limited Beta → Public” gates.              | Embed _pseudocode PR_ step in GitHub Actions; no sprint closes without device matrix coverage.                   |
| **L9 • Mobile Publishing**              | Mapped Apple vs Google submission checklists & test‑device heuristics.                          | Zero rejection streak since—metadata & screenshots automated via Fastlane lanes.                                 |
| **L10 • Post‑Production**               | Modeled **Fun × Audio × Graphics × Uniqueness × Replayability** formula for marketability.      | Funnel analytics dashboards through the same multiplier to flag low‑replay screens.                              |
| **L11 • Career Pathing**                | Audited eroding barriers: hardware, software, publishing.                                       | Position personal brand as **“one‑person studio”**.                                                              |
| **L12 • Capstone**                      | Assembled concept → GDD → prototype → pitch deck in 48 h.                                       | Repurpose template for investor briefs on my smart‑repair SaaS spin‑off.                                         |

## 3 ‧ Translating Theory Into Shipping Muscle

### 3.1 Indie‑Scale PM Framework

1. **Mock‑Up → Milestone → Playtest loops.** 5‑day cadence keeps scope visible to stakeholders _and_ my future self.
2. **Asset Ledger in Git LFS.** Every sprite, SFX, or SQL script tags owner + license + version—no more Slack archaeology.
3. **Alpha “Chaos Days.”** Borrowing from lesson‑8 testing, each Friday I run _(low battery, slow network, rotated UI, VoiceOver)_ gauntlets. If a build passes that, prod feels trivial.

### 3.2 UX Upgrades Already Live

- **Dynamic Difficulty (Adaptive Element).** DoneTodo’s streak visuals now brighten/shrink based on completion momentum.
- **Micro‑Quest Onboarding.** Borrowed _Goal → Win State → Feedback_ triad to replace monolithic tutorials with 60‑second “quests” that teach swipes, long‑presses, and calendar sync. Engagement up **18 %** week‑over‑week.

### 3.3 Leadership Hacks

- **Prefix‑Driven Email Taxonomy (`[DoneTodo] QA Hotfix #42`).** Cut hand‑offs confusion by 40 %.
- **Time‑Zone Matrix:** Auto‑generated Notion page lists contributor UTC offsets & “deep‑work windows.” Meetings dropped from 9 h to 4 h per sprint.

## Final Thought

Game development isn’t a detour from app engineering, it’s the R&D lab where engagement physics are discovered. After this course, my toolbelt feels heavier in the best possible way.
