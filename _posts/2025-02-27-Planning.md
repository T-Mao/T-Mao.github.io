## Introduction

At SupTech, I played a dual role as both an app developer and ad-hoc project manager, constructing **two** cross-platform mobile applications (_Consumer_ and _Technician_) from scratch. Beyond the codebase, I took on tasks ranging from UI/UX design, AI integrations, backend bridging, to seemingly unrelated chores like handling HR tasks, scheduling business errands, and assisting with high-level product decisions.

This broad involvement taught me two critical lessons:

1. **Technical Mastery & Adaptability**  
   Handling front-end, backend integrations, AI, and advanced mobile functionalities not only showcased my coding capabilities but forced me to **rapidly learn** new technologies and architectural decisions.
2. **Project Management & Leadership**  
   Building the apps from zero demanded strong communication, stakeholder alignment, and iterative agile planning. I ended up spearheading scope documentation, release notes, and cross-department communications.

In this post, I'll outline:

- **My Achievements** at SupTech
- **Lessons Learned**: Tech & Management
- **Future Directions**: Deeper specialization, bigger tech challenges, or new environment?
- **Personal Brand**: How to transform my experiences into an impressive portfolio

## SupTech: A Quick Recap

### End-to-End App Development

**Consumer App** for customers and **Technician App** for service providers, both built with **Flutter** and integrated with a new MySQL/Java backend. These apps serve a unified pipeline:

- **Real-time location tracking**, geospatial queries
- **AI-based fault diagnosis** (AI Repair) using GPT-like LLM
- **Stripe** for secure payments and scheduled disbursements
- Localization in English & Chinese
- UI/UX with creative design patterns and code-sharing

### AI Integration: GPT-based Repair Chat

I integrated a ChatGPT-like AI chatbot to help users self-diagnose common issues. The GPT integration gave customers a guided Q&A flow:

- **Interactive debugging**: Step-by-step cause identification
- **Self-service solutions** with recommended parts & instructions
- Seamless fallback to technician dispatch if the user decides to request a pro service

### Project Management & More

From writing product requirement documents (PRD) and drawing mind maps to daily standups and sprint retros, I led scope clarifications and architecture decisions. Meanwhile, I found myself tackling administrative tasks like shipping company packages, reorganizing HR schedules, or even tutoring the boss’s kids—situations typical of a lean startup environment.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Full-Stack Mobile Expertise**  
   In building iOS/Android apps with Flutter, hooking into Node/Firebase first, then bridging to MySQL/Java:

   - Mastered cross-platform app dev in **Flutter** with advanced state management (Riverpod/Provider).
   - **AI** integration (OpenAI GPT-like LLM).
   - Payment with **Stripe**: PaymentIntents, Connect accounts, scheduled transfers.
   - Real-time geolocation using geospatial queries, push notifications via FCM.

2. **Leadership & PM Skills**

   - Owned the entire dev cycle: Requirements → Architecture → Release.
   - Documented tasks, mind maps, and timelines. Acted as the bridging point between dev, design, and stakeholders.
   - Balanced multiple roles under intense deadlines, validated solutions quickly, pivoted as specs changed.

3. **Adaptability & Problem-Solving**

   - Frequent shifting priorities demanded **fast context switching**—one moment coding AI chat flows, the next debugging a location-based service, or stepping into design review calls.
   - Mentored junior devs, set up code reviews, and implemented agile-like sprints.

4. **Personal Growth**
   - Developed advanced debugging under pressure (one-person dev team for months).
   - Gained resilience and communication prowess, bridging business logic with technical feasibility to keep the project on track.

## Future Directions

1. **Deeper Specialization vs. Broader Tech**

   - **Option A**: Join a high-level app development team or SaaS company, diving deeper into performance optimizations, architectural patterns, or specialized AI-driven features. Possibly iOS (SwiftUI + Combine) or React Native advanced.
   - **Option B**: Continue wearing multiple hats at a startup with big tech challenges, focusing on AI integration, large data sets, or building robust cross-platform systems.

2. **Environment & Collaboration**

   - I’m seeking a workplace with **mentorship and code quality** standards, plus a strong engineering culture.
   - Eager for **larger-scale** collaboration: code reviews, TDD, refined CI/CD pipelines, and well-structured product management.

3. **Bigger Tech Challenges**
   - Keen to integrate advanced AI/LLMs, push the boundaries in fields like AR/VR or real-time streaming.
   - Open to tackling large concurrency issues, robust microservice ecosystems, or sophisticated user analytics.

## Conclusion

Working at SupTech was both **exhausting** and **transformative**. I proved my ability to architect, implement, and ship real-time AI-driven mobile apps under intense deadlines—while also juggling unplanned operational tasks. This intense experience shaped me into a more **self-sufficient**, detail-oriented developer and manager.

As I look ahead to new opportunities, I want to:

1. Join a **more specialized team** or environment that fosters quality engineering and bigger technical challenges.
2. Bring my unique **full-stack** plus **AI** integration background, enabling robust, cutting-edge apps.
3. Continue building a **personal brand** around advanced app dev, strong problem solving, and leadership.

**If you’re seeking a developer** who can tackle complex app problems from scratch, integrate AI, manage cross-functional teams, and handle unexpected tasks with resilience—I’d love to connect and explore what we can build together.
