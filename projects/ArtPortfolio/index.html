This project challenged me to convey an urgent environmental message through visuals alone. I combined stark imagery (such as silhouettes of factories and polluted skies) with a limited color palette of smoky grays and toxic greens to dramatize the contrast between clean air and pollution. The design includes a bold headline warning and a call-to-action urging viewers to consider sustainable practices. Through careful composition and symbolic elements (like a gradually fading city skyline), the poster effectively communicates its point without excessive text. This piece reflects my belief in design as a tool for social impact and demonstrates how I can apply my skills to promote awareness on global issues.</p> <p><br></p> <h3 id="speech--debate-team-poster--speech-follies-2018">Speech &amp; Debate Team Poster – “Speech Follies” (2018)</h3> <p><br></p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PosterDesignedbyTongzeMao-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PosterDesignedbyTongzeMao-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PosterDesignedbyTongzeMao-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PosterDesignedbyTongzeMao.jpg" class="rounded z-depth-0" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 300px; " title="Speech &amp; Debate Team Poster (2018)" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><br></p> <p>One of my proudest graphic design achievements was this poster for my school’s Speech and Debate Team, designed over winter 2018–2019. The school held a contest calling for student-created promotional posters, and my design was selected as the winner from dozens of submissions. Breaking away from the school’s traditionally conservative poster style, I developed a bold and modern concept. Using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, I incorporated dynamic visuals (including stylized speech symbols, vibrant geometric shapes, and a striking color scheme) to capture the excitement and intellectual energy of speech and debate. I drew inspiration from both past team posters and professional event marketing designs, ensuring the final product was unique yet fitting. The poster was printed in large format and displayed across every classroom and hallway on campus, as well as at external venues, to recruit and energize team members. Team members even paraded a giant version of the poster around campus to drum up interest.</p> <p><br></p> <h3 id="speech--debate-event-program-2020">Speech &amp; Debate Event Program (2020)</h3> <p><br></p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PROGRAM-2020-01-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PROGRAM-2020-01-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PROGRAM-2020-01-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PROGRAM-2020-01.jpg" class="rounded z-depth-0" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 240px; " title="Speech &amp; Debate Event Program (2020) – cover" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PROGRAM-2020-02-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PROGRAM-2020-02-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PROGRAM-2020-02-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/SPEECH-FOLLIES-PROGRAM-2020-02.jpg" class="rounded z-depth-0" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 240px; " title="Speech &amp; Debate Event Program (2020) – inner page" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><br></p> <p>Following the success of the Speech &amp; Debate poster, I was asked to design the program booklet for the team’s annual showcase event in 2020.

This project involved layout design and typesetting for multiple pages of content (event schedules, participant names, and acknowledgments), which I executed using Adobe InDesign for professional-level formatting. The challenge was to organize information clearly while still maintaining an engaging design that reflected the lively spirit of the Speech &amp; Debate community. The completed programs were distributed at the event, and many attendees noted their polished, magazine-quality look.</p> <p><br></p> <h3 id="georgia-okeeffe--exhibit-bookmark--interactive-invitation-2019">Georgia O’Keeffe — Exhibit Bookmark &amp; Interactive Invitation (2019)</h3> <p><br></p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/BookMark1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/BookMark1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/BookMark1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/BookMark1.jpg" class="rounded z-depth-0" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 260px; " title="Exhibit Bookmark — Georgia O’Keeffe (2019)" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/invitation-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/invitation-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/invitation-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/invitation.jpg" class="rounded z-depth-0" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 260px; " title="Interactive Invitation Card — Georgia O’Keeffe (2019)" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Concept &amp; Role:</strong> MoMA-inspired promotional collateral for a themed exhibition about <strong>Georgia O’Keeffe</strong>.<br> <strong>What I did:</strong> Built a cohesive <strong>type system</strong> and <strong>gridded layout</strong>, balancing modernist restraint with bold focal imagery.

This was both an honor and a significant responsibility, as the poster would serve as the primary advertisement for the exhibition to students, parents, and the community. I began by researching the year’s exhibition theme and reviewing prior years’ promotional materials. Wanting to create something fresh, I conceptualized a modern design featuring geometric shapes and a bold, contemporary color palette to reflect the diversity of art that would be on display (ranging from painting and photography to digital media). I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to bring the concept to life, carefully integrating the event details into the artwork so that the information was clear without disrupting the visual flow. The final poster was printed and posted around campus and city community centers, helping to drive higher attendance to the exhibition. Event organizers praised the poster’s eye-catching aesthetics and how well it captured the spirit of the art show. This project was a capstone of my high school graphic design experience, allowing me to apply everything I had learned about visual hierarchy, thematic design, and audience engagement.</p> <p><br></p> <h3 id="principles-of-design-educational-poster-2018">Principles of Design Educational Poster (2018)</h3> <p><br></p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/PRINCIPLES-OF-DESIGN-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/PRINCIPLES-OF-DESIGN-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/GraphicDesign/PRINCIPLES-OF-DESIGN-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/GraphicDesign/PRINCIPLES-OF-DESIGN.jpg" class="rounded z-depth-0" width="100%" height="auto" style=" max-width: 300px; " title="Principles of Design Educational Poster (2018)" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p><br></p> <p>Created as a capstone project for my introductory graphic design class in 2018, this poster showcases my interpretation of the eight fundamental Principles of Design (Balance, Contrast, Emphasis, Movement, Pattern, Rhythm, Unity, and Variety). Rather than simply listing definitions, I designed a series of eight mini-illustrations within the poster, each visually demonstrating two principles in tandem. For example, one segment might display contrast through opposing colors while also illustrating balance in its symmetrical layout. Another segment could show rhythm via repeating shapes and incorporate variety with changing colors or sizes. By blending principles in each composition, I challenged myself to think creatively about how design concepts manifest visually. The overall poster is an educational piece that helped my classmates (and myself) better understand and remember these core ideas through art.

I explored a variety of styles – from playful and modern to elegant and minimalist – ensuring that each logo variation could represent the company in a unique way. This involved careful choice of color schemes (e.g. refreshing blues to evoke water or vibrant hues to suggest fragrances), typography that matched the brand’s personality, and iconography (such as abstract water droplets, leaf motifs for natural ingredients, etc.) to reinforce the product theme. Through multiple iterations and peer critiques, I refined each concept to be clear, scalable, and memorable. The final logos demonstrated my versatility in visual ideation and execution.

I chose bright, inviting colors and a simple illustration style to appeal to a broad audience. The sticker was printed and distributed widely; students could be seen pasting them on notebooks and water bottles, turning the campaign into a mini-trend. By condensing a public service message into a sticker-sized design, I learned how to maximize impact with minimal space – focusing on a single focal graphic and very concise text. The popularity of the sticker (many students wanted one) also taught me about the viral potential of relatable design.

Aimed to be adorable and amusing, the monster has big round eyes and a shaggy, colorful body that make it instantly lovable. I designed it to convey a cheerful emotion – perfect for users to send as a reaction in chats. The sticker’s design emphasizes simplicity and bold shapes, which is key for readability at the small sizes used in messaging apps. After release, this single sticker surprisingly also garnered thousands of sends, proving popular among users who enjoyed its quirky charm. Through creating the monster and crocodile stickers, I learned how to adapt my artwork to meet the technical constraints of digital platforms (such as sizing and background transparency) and how important it is to capture a character’s personality in just one frame. This creative exercise in character design further broadened my skill set, and it underscores my ability to produce engaging content that can thrive in today’s digital communication channels.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Link:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong>Fluffy Monster Sticker</strong>: <a href="https://sticker.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/mmemoticon-bin/emoticonview?oper=single&amp;t=shop/detail&amp;productid=aL2PCfwK/89qO7sF6/+I+UDhfwEjhec2ZNvdnLLJRd/PbdO9ncdHotin6RaeHF7YjZQWjiHa8I4x7Gn5NGCm3NDym0SbdfMVLUk4FaXkjB/0=" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">View on WeChat Stickers</a> </li> </ul> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <hr> <p><br></p> <h2 id="achievements--recognition">Achievements &amp; Recognition</h2> <ul> <li> <p>International Art Competition: Future Art China 2017 – Achieved Top 100 out of 10,000+ entries; artwork exhibited at the Lincoln Center (NYC) and featured in a commemorative art book.</p> </li> <li> <p>School Poster Contests: Winner of multiple school-wide design competitions, including the Speech &amp; Debate Team poster (selected from dozens of submissions) and the Arcadia High Art Exhibition poster (chosen to represent the entire event).</p> </li> <li> <p>Campus Exhibitions: Numerous works selected for distinguished display – for instance, several of my posters and art pieces were chosen for permanent exhibition in school hallways and annual art shows, recognizing their impact and excellence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Community &amp; Client Impact: Designed real-world promotional materials for organizations (e.g. Orchesis Dance Company) that were implemented successfully, boosting engagement and attendance at events.
