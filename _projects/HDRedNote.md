## Overview

From **June 2024** to **December 2024**, I served as a **remote, part-time New Media Content Creator** at **HD EDU**, focusing on **Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book)** operations for the organization’s official account. Although this role differed from my typical app development background, I consistently leveraged a **tech-driven**, **data-informed** approach—similar to how I structure, optimize, and iterate on apps in the software realm. By blending **creative writing**, **social platform analytics**, and **overseas brand strategy**, I strengthened my skill set in **user-focused** content creation and enhanced my cross-functional effectiveness—traits equally important in product development and coding.

## Project Highlights

1. **Social Media Strategy & Execution**  
   - Managed HD EDU’s official **Xiaohongshu** account, crafting original content for **study-abroad** audiences.  
   - Employed a **minimalist**, **clear** writing style, ensuring content was concise, visually engaging, and easy to grasp—mirroring the clarity I strive for in my code and UI/UX design.

2. **Creative Conceptualization & Production**  
   - Produced **experience-based** posts, daily tips, and comedic or entertaining education snippets—maintaining a consistent schedule that followed user engagement data.  
   - Experimented with **graphic design** and short-form text, refining a style akin to “clean-coded” visuals—ensuring clarity, branding alignment, and audience appeal.

3. **Data-Informed Iterations**  
   - Monitored engagement metrics (views, likes, shares, dwell time), allowing me to tweak content scheduling and thematic direction.  
   - Iterative improvement loop: similar to **A/B testing** in app dev, tested different headlines, visuals, or posting times, then used analytics to optimize user response.

4. **Cross-Cultural Insights & Language Adaptation**  
   - Drew on my **overseas study experience** to create relevant content for Chinese students studying abroad, bridging cultural nuances and comedic references.  
   - Balanced **bilingual** content strategy, ensuring clarity for both domestic and international audiences, analogous to handling **internationalization** in software.

## Project Details

### 1. New Media Operations on Xiaohongshu

**Purpose:** Connect with prospective and current overseas students, build brand awareness, and amplify HD EDU’s presence in digital channels.

- **Daily Content Updates**:  
  - Published study tips, campus life diaries, and entertainment posts multiple times a week to maintain user engagement.  
  - Ensured text brevity and visual consistency—just as I strive for efficient, maintainable code structures.

- **Engagement Tactics**:
  - Coordinated daily Q&A comments, friendly responses to feedback, and timely updates—akin to real-time bug tracking in app dev.  
  - Developed “experience-based” original posts, including “How to Survive Final Exams” or “Best Budgeting Tips Abroad.”

### 2. Analytics & Continuous Improvement

**Purpose:** Refine content based on performance data, ensuring maximum reach and user satisfaction.

- **Metrics-Driven**:
  - Monitored post performance metrics (CTR, saves, shares), employing a data pipeline reminiscent of analytics in software sprints.  
  - Identified peak engagement hours to schedule critical content drops.

- **Creative Iteration**:
  - Ran micro-experiments with short vs. long captions, bullet lists vs. mini-infographics, comparing user reactions.  
  - Treated each post cycle as a “mini-release,” adjusting next iterations based on “version feedback” from the audience.

### 3. Technical Parallels & Skill Overlaps

**Purpose:** Bring a “developer mindset” to social media marketing and highlight synergy between content creation & product dev.

- **Workflow & Efficiency**:
  - Automated repetitive tasks (e.g., post scheduling, keyword research) using free online scripts—reflecting the automation approach used in CI/CD pipelines.  
  - Organized all creative assets with naming conventions and version control—paralleling Git-based processes.

- **Structured Brainstorming**:
  - Adopted “sprint planning” for content: backlog of ideas, weekly stand-ups with the marketing lead, daily backlog grooming—akin to agile methodology.  
  - Mapped user profiles (personas) to tailor tone and style, echoing user-centric design in app development.

## My Additional Responsibilities

- **Brand Expansion**:  
  - Collaborated with cross-border e-learning teams to unify brand voice across different platforms.  
  - Provided feedback on web or landing pages, applying UI/UX best practices from my dev experience, ensuring brand cohesion.

- **Ad Hoc Creative Tasks**:  
  - Participated in short design sprints for upcoming marketing campaigns, bridging design sensibility with data insights.  
  - Assisted with small-scale HR tasks, such as screening design interns who might contribute to social media visuals.

- **Community Interaction**:  
  - Proactively engaged with user comments, offering warm, solution-oriented responses—mirroring how I handle user feedback in app dev cycles.  
  - Encouraged user feedback via polls, echoing the way we gather user stories or acceptance criteria in agile dev.

## Technical Contributions

**Content Workflow Automation**  
- Created basic **Python scripts** to parse raw text files, produce snippet variations, and schedule posts in a more structured pipeline—akin to a mini “build pipeline” for creative output.

**Efficiency & Quality**  
- Employed “checklists” for each post (like code reviews), ensuring grammar clarity, brand alignment, and consistent style guidelines.  
- Leveraged analytics dashboards (similar to product dashboards) to quickly pinpoint content that underperforms and rework them.

**Platform & Integration**  
- Explored integration between Xiaohongshu and official HD EDU websites, ensuring consistent referral flows.  
- Adapted SEO-friendly text formats, reminiscent of optimizing for best performance on app store listings.
