## Overview

From **June 2024** to **December 2024**, I worked part-time and **remotely** at **HD EDU** as a **New Media Content Creator**, overseeing the organization’s official **Xiaohongshu (rednote)** channel. My goal was to engage Chinese students studying abroad through concise, visually appealing posts—using a **systematic**, **data-informed** approach to maintain a compelling brand presence. By fusing **creative writing**, **social media analytics**, and personal experience with international education, I delivered content that resonated with HD EDU’s audience and amplified user engagement.

In practice, I approached each piece of content with an **iterative** mindset—methodically brainstorming topics, drafting posts, collecting metrics, and refining for future cycles. This allowed me to produce consistent, quality materials while quickly reacting to shifting audience interests or marketing objectives. As a result, HD EDU saw steady growth in followers and daily interactions, reflecting the value of a well-structured publishing routine driven by clear, relevant storytelling.

## Project Highlights

1. **Social Media Content Strategy**

   - **Daily/Weekly Posts**: Rolled out creative topics around study-abroad tips, campus survival guides, budgeting, or comedic short reads, balancing entertainment with useful insights.
   - **Targeted Minimalism**: Adopted a clean, direct writing style—keeping text punchy and visually consistent for busy online users.

2. **Creative Production & Scheduling**

   - **Experience-Based Posts**: Shared personal stories and tips from my overseas studies, adding authentic humor and relatable visuals to engage potential or current international students.
   - **Iterative Ideation**: Maintained a backlog of content ideas, tested different headings or images, and tracked results to refine future posts.

3. **Analytics & Refinement**

   - **Engagement Tracking**: Monitored metrics such as likes, saves, and average view duration. Adapted postings to peak audience hours, ensuring maximum reach.
   - **Community Feedback Loop**: Leveraged user comments, poll responses, and direct messages to discover trending topics. Rapidly adjusted content angles for stronger resonance.

4. **Cross-Cultural & Bilingual Touch**

   - **Localized Style**: Blended cultural references with comedic anecdotes for Chinese students abroad, bridging differences and building an inviting brand voice.
   - **Language Adaptation**: Occasionally produced bilingual content, ensuring clarity for both domestic and overseas audiences seeking HD EDU’s programs.

## Project Details

### 1. New Media Operations

**Purpose:** Increase brand recognition among study-abroad audiences, highlight HD EDU’s services, and cultivate an engaged community on Xiaohongshu.

- **Regular Updates**: Published multiple times per week. Combined short tips (e.g., “Exam Survival 101”) with comedic stories to sustain steady interactions.
- **Visually Cohesive Approach**: Applied consistent color themes, fonts, and layout guidelines. This visual unity made the channel look more professional and aligned with HD EDU’s brand identity.

### 2. Data & Iterative Improvement

**Purpose:** Continuously refine content by systematically reviewing performance.

- **Metrics-Oriented**: Checked standard metrics (CTR, shares, dwell time) to see what resonated. If certain topics or styles underperformed, revised or tested alternate formats in the next round.
- **Structured Feedback**: Gathered direct viewer suggestions, then incorporated relevant tips or comments into subsequent posts—fostering a sense of community.

### 3. Organized Creative Flow

**Purpose:** Keep content output efficient and maintain a smooth pipeline from idea to publication.

- **Content Calendar**: Ran a monthly editorial schedule, balancing fun posts, serious tips, and Q&A pieces.
- **Micro-Batch Creation**: Produced multiple related topics in short sprints, saving time and ensuring consistent messaging.

## My Additional Responsibilities

- **Brand Consistency**

  - Aligned Xiaohongshu content with HD EDU’s broader marketing (official website, other social channels), ensuring cohesive voice and style.
  - Offered design input for marketing materials, bridging text and visuals in promotional banners or campaign graphics.

- **Ad Hoc Creative Tasks**

  - Assisted in design sprints for upcoming campaigns—brainstorming themes, drafting initial visuals, and finalizing narrative elements.
  - Collaborated with internal teams (e.g., web design, HR) on smaller content pieces highlighting new tutors or specialized programs.

- **Community Engagement**

  - Maintained a friendly, responsive comment section—answering queries about HD EDU’s offerings, clarifying study-abroad concerns, and acknowledging user feedback.
  - Organized small-scale giveaways or user polls for increased engagement, fueling recurring traffic to the account.

## Technical Contributions

**Content Workflow & Automation**

- Created simple scripts to batch-rename images, generate short captions, and schedule posts in a more structured pipeline.
- Employed basic cloud-based version control to store draft images, captions, and old posts, ensuring easy retrieval of successful formats.

**Efficiency & QA**

- Utilized checklists for each release: verifying grammar, alignment with brand tone, and post timing. This mirrored the “quality assurance” approach used in other fields requiring consistent output.
- Deployed built-in Xiaohongshu analytics to identify anomalies or flagged content, ensuring stable channel performance.

**Platform Integration**

- Explored cross-traffic from Xiaohongshu to HD EDU’s official site, optimizing short link usage and CTA wording.
- Recommended SEO-friendly text structures for HD EDU’s webpage disclaimers, lightly mirroring metadata optimization methods used in tech fields.

- **Unified Brand Image**: Maintained consistent color palettes, text style, and brand persona, thereby boosting user trust and channel recognition.
- **Enhanced Community Spirit**: Through warm, user-centric posts and helpful advice, the account became a supportive space for prospective or current overseas students.

## Personal Growth & Reflection

**Systems Thinking**:

- Organized content creation as a cycle of ideation, production, and performance review—reinforcing the structured mindset I find valuable in many professional settings.

**Communication & Storytelling**:

- Learned to convey short, direct messages that resonate quickly—an important skill whether drafting social media copy or summarizing complex ideas for any project team.

**Adaptability & Responsiveness**:

- Managed shifting editorial calendars and user interest trends. Balanced creativity with real-time feedback, ensuring posts remained timely and user-relevant.

## Final Thoughts

Though centered on **digital outreach** rather than technical development, my work at **HD EDU** honed an **iterative**, **user-focused** perspective—managing content like micro-projects, with cycles of planning, creation, and adaptation. This experience sharpened my ability to **communicate**, **organize resources**, and **work across teams**, all of which are equally valuable in delivering effective solutions, whether in marketing or any other professional endeavor.
