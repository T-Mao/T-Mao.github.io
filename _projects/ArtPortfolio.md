## Overview

My creative journey in art and graphic design is a multi-faceted extension of my technical discipline. Trained through Arcadia High School’s rigorous Graphic Design curriculum (Introductory and Advanced levels), I learned core principles of composition, color, and typography while mastering industry-standard tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. Through challenging projects – ranging from fine art sketches to real-world client posters – I honed an innovative eye for detail, strong visual communication skills, and the ability to problem-solve creatively. This artistic foundation complements my software engineering pursuits, giving me a unique perspective that fuses technical precision with creative design thinking.

Below is a curated portfolio of my artwork and design projects, grouped by category. Each piece is accompanied by a brief description, highlighting the context, techniques, and impact or recognition received.

</div>
</div>

<br>

Created as a capstone project for my introductory graphic design class in 2018, this poster showcases my interpretation of the eight fundamental Principles of Design (Balance, Contrast, Emphasis, Movement, Pattern, Rhythm, Unity, and Variety). Rather than simply listing definitions, I designed a series of eight mini-illustrations within the poster, each visually demonstrating two principles in tandem. For example, one segment might display contrast through opposing colors while also illustrating balance in its symmetrical layout. Another segment could show rhythm via repeating shapes and incorporate variety with changing colors or sizes. By blending principles in each composition, I challenged myself to think creatively about how design concepts manifest visually. The overall poster is an educational piece that helped my classmates (and myself) better understand and remember these core ideas through art. This project underlined my ability to convey complex concepts through simple graphics.

</div>
</div>

<br>

As part of my advanced graphic design course in 2019, I undertook a branding project to create a logo suite for a fictional bath products company named “ULike.” The challenge was to design six distinct logos that each present a creative concept for the brand. I explored a variety of styles – from playful and modern to elegant and minimalist – ensuring that each logo variation could represent the company in a unique way. This involved careful choice of color schemes (e.g. refreshing blues to evoke water or vibrant hues to suggest fragrances), typography that matched the brand’s personality, and iconography (such as abstract water droplets, leaf motifs for natural ingredients, etc.) to reinforce the product theme. Through multiple iterations and peer critiques, I refined each concept to be clear, scalable, and memorable. The final logos demonstrated my versatility in visual ideation and execution. This project was a valuable introduction to brand identity design, teaching me how consistency and creativity must balance when crafting the face of a company.

In 2021, I ventured into digital illustration for social media, creating a series of expressive crocodile character stickers. Shown above are two examples from the set, each featuring a cute, cartoonish crocodile in different moods. I developed this character to be both humorous and endearing, using a bold outline style and bright colors to ensure it stands out in chat messages. The process involved sketching by hand on a tablet and then vectoring the artwork for crisp scaling. These stickers were published in a popular messaging app’s sticker gallery, where they quickly gained traction – accumulating over 10,000 sends in chats. Users loved the crocodile’s playful expressions, from an eye-rolling sarcastic croc to a laughing, toothy grin. The popularity of this sticker pack was a rewarding validation of my digital illustration skills and taught me about designing for an interactive audience. It was exciting to see how a fun side project leveraging my artistic talents could resonate with thousands of people, much like a well-crafted piece of software can touch many users.

Another digital sticker created in 2021, this furry little monster character showcases a different art style. Aimed to be adorable and amusing, the monster has big round eyes and a shaggy, colorful body that make it instantly lovable. I designed it to convey a cheerful emotion – perfect for users to send as a reaction in chats. The sticker’s design emphasizes simplicity and bold shapes, which is key for readability at the small sizes used in messaging apps. After release, this single sticker surprisingly also garnered thousands of sends, proving popular among users who enjoyed its quirky charm. Through creating the monster and crocodile stickers, I learned how to adapt my artwork to meet the technical constraints of digital platforms (such as sizing and background transparency) and how important it is to capture a character’s personality in just one frame. This creative exercise in character design further broadened my skill set, and it underscores my ability to produce engaging content that can thrive in today’s digital communication channels.
