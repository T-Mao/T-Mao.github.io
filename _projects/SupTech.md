## Overview

During my time at **SupTech**, I took on the challenge of building two large-scale mobile applications in **Flutter**—the **SupTech Consumer App** (C-end) and **SupTech Technician App** (T-end). I was not only responsible for **designing and coding** these apps but also took on roles typically divided among multiple teams in larger companies.

Throughout the process, I specialized in:

1. **Full-cycle App Development**: from **requirement gathering**, system architecture, responsive UI design, to final deployment on both iOS and Android.
2. **Cross-platform Flutter**: building robust, fluid interfaces supporting multiple languages (English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese).
3. **Backend Integration**: initially leveraging **Firebase-based serverless functions (Node.js)** for rapid prototyping, then moving to a **MySQL/Java** architecture to ensure stable data synchronization, authentication, push notifications, and real-time location tracking.
4. **Stripe Payment Integration**: implementing secure payment flows, creating and attaching payment methods, and enabling technicians to bind their bank accounts for receiving payouts.
5. **Team Coordination & Leadership**: bridging communication between stakeholders, gathering app requirements, leading daily stand-ups, and guiding new hires. I also assumed responsibilities like a Project Manager, documenting tasks, drawing mind maps, making swimlane diagrams, and clarifying business logic with the in-house or external tech teams.

Below is a more detailed breakdown of my work.

</div>

### 1. The SupTech Consumer App (C-end)

**Purpose:** Provide consumers with an easy way to request installation/repair services, track order statuses, chat with assigned technicians, and leverage **AI Repair** for self-diagnosis.

- **Built with Flutter**: Ensuring a consistent UI/UX across iOS and Android.
- **User-Centric Flows**:
  - Account creation & login
  - Order creation & management (brand/SKU selection, photo upload, location pin)
  - Secure online payment (integrating with **Stripe**)
  - Chat system (real-time messaging & photo exchange)
  - Rating and feedback
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese.

### 2. The SupTech Technician App (T-end)

**Purpose:** Empower field technicians to view and accept nearby orders, manage scheduling, provide real-time service updates, and handle payments.

- **Location-Based Task Allocation**:
  - Built real-time location services with geofencing logic (50mi radius) for relevant orders.
- **In-app Communication**:
  - Integrated chat with consumers
  - Provided custom action buttons (e.g., “Depart Now,” “Begin Service,” “Complete Service”).
- **Stripe Connect**:
  - Technicians can link their bank account for direct payouts.
- **Work Dashboard & Performance**:
  - Real-time income stats, upcoming tasks, and completed tasks counter.

### 3. AI Repair Integration

I implemented a custom **AI chatbot** (powered by Chat GPT 4.0) within both apps—**C-end** and **T-end**—for fault diagnosis:

- **Prompt engineering**: to ensure the AI’s language is user-friendly and robust enough to guide users (even novices) through potential troubleshooting steps.
- **Conversation flow**: multiple-step guidance from hypothesizing the fault cause to deciding whether to do self-repair or request a technician’s visit.

### 4. Cross-Platform + Real-time Features

- **Hybrid Backend**:
  - Legacy Firebase-based serverless functions (Node.js)
  - New MySQL/Java-based API for production scale.
- **Real-time Bidding**: Technicians see instantly updated order info as location or status changes.
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging for timely updates (e.g., new tasks assigned, new messages).
- **Payment Workflow**:
  - Customer -> Stripe -> SupTech -> Technician
  - Delayed payout scheduling and partial refunds via custom logic.

<br>

## My Additional Responsibilities

Besides solely focusing on app coding, I played multiple roles:

- **Project Manager**:
  - Held requirement-gathering meetings, created mind maps and swimlane diagrams, documented all changes, and aligned them with the dev tasks.
  - Handled stakeholder requests, bridging business logic with technical feasibility.
- **Ad Hoc Tasks**:
  - Assisted with HR tasks: from screening candidates to orienting new hires.
  - Built the company’s basic web presence and fixed design issues on official website.
  - Occasionally performed office errands (e.g., shipping packages, setting up coworker computers, supporting system admin tasks).
  - Engaged in cross-team communication, from clarifying B-end system queries to instructing business partners on how to utilize the new AI chat modules.
- **Release & Store Management**:
  - Single-handedly managed app submissions to Apple’s App Store and Google Play.
  - Coordinated store listing, test flight/beta testing cycles, and official rollout.

1. **Flutter Architecture**

   - Implemented **Provider** & **Riverpod** for state management in different modules.
   - Optimized performance with asynchronous data streams (StreamBuilders) + caching (SharedPreferences).

2. **Multi-Language & Internationalization**

   - Organized translations in `.arb`/`.json` files, ensuring easy expansions to new languages.
   - Dynamically switched UI texts based on system language or user preference.

3. **Stripe Payment & Connect**

   - Built robust flow for PaymentMethod creation, ephemeral keys handling, PaymentIntents, and Connect-based payouts to technicians.
   - RSA encryption for sensitive data, ephemeral token usage for web hooks.

4. **Location & Map Integrations**

   - Deployed Google Maps SDK for in-app location display, technician route mapping, and geo-based filtering of tasks.
   - Handling iOS & Android location permission differences, background location updates, and UI refresh cycles.

5. **AI Chat & Prompt Engineering**
   - Built Chat GPT 4.0 conversation flows, ensuring clear step-by-step troubleshooting guides, brand/SKU/fault code recognition, and user-linguistic style adaptation.

<br>

## Project Outcomes

- **Faster Customer-Provider Matching**: By building a robust cross-platform solution with real-time location-based order dispatch, the company drastically reduced manual dispatch overhead.
- **Reduced Support Overhead**: The integrated chat system & AI assistance lowered the number of repeated phone calls and manual troubleshooting queries.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Transition from Firebase-based quick prototypes to a more scalable MySQL/Java environment. Performance under high concurrency improved significantly.
- **Business Value**: Enhanced brand image with modern, user-friendly apps. Gained potential to expand the service across wider regions and device platforms.

<br>

## Personal Growth & Reflection

**Technical Mastery**:

- Deepened my expertise in Flutter, including advanced state management, custom animations, and platform-specific integrations.
- Gained hands-on experience with Node.js serverless functions and MySQL-based microservices.

**Project Management & Communication**:

- Learned to swiftly re-assess scope when business logic changed.
- Strengthened stakeholder communication, from clarifying ambiguous requirements to training end-users.

**Adaptability & Tenacity**:

- Faced tight deadlines and frequently shifting requirements.
- Wore multiple hats—developer, coordinator, occasional HR or admin tasks—demonstrating resilience and a can-do attitude.

## Final Thoughts

My experience at SupTech was both demanding and rewarding. I took pride in **shipping two fully functional Flutter apps**—from scratch to production—and integrating them with dynamic, AI-powered features.  
Though the path was challenging, I honed my full-stack understanding, sharpened my project management skills, and grew more confident as an **App Developer** ready for new frontiers.

I believe these experiences and the robust code I wrote can significantly contribute to any team seeking a **passionate** developer with **multi-faceted** problem-solving skills and an eye for **quality software** that truly serves its end users.
