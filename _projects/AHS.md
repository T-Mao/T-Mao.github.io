## Overview

During my time at **Arcadia High School**, I immersed myself in **multi-faceted coursework**, from honors and AP-level classes to advanced design projects. I graduated **Salutatorian** (GPA 3.97/4.0), reflecting a commitment to both academic rigor and broad creative exploration. Whether excelling in **AP Computer Science A** (score of 5), or working on digital arts and promotional posters, I embraced each challenge with **adaptability**, **technical precision**, and **innovative thinking**—the same qualities that continue to guide my professional pursuits today.

<br>

## Highlights and Responsibilities

### 1. Salutatorian & Academic Distinction

- **Academic Excellence**

  - Maintained a **3.97 GPA** while tackling courses like AP Calculus AB (scored **5**), Honors-level math (Geometry (H), Algebra 2 (H), Precalculus), AP Physics, and more.
  - Achieved **5** in **AP Computer Science A**, emphasizing my proficiency in **object-oriented programming**, data structures, and algorithmic problem-solving.
  - Demonstrated the dedication, leadership, and discipline required for **Salutatorian** honors.

- **High SAT Subject & Language Scores**
  - Scored **790** on **SAT Mathematics Level II**, underscoring strong analytical skills.
  - Achieved **800** on **Chinese Listening**, reflecting bilingual communication capacity.

### 2. Advanced Design & Creative Projects

- **Speech & Debate Team Poster**

  - Won the **schoolwide design contest** from hundreds of submissions.
  - Used **Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator** to develop a bold poster that significantly **increased awareness** for the team, showcased in every classroom and across campus.

- **Annual Art Exhibition Poster & Artwork**
  - Created the official poster for the **Arcadia High School Art Exhibition**: integrated modern typography and vibrant color schemes to attract broader attendance.
  - Had a **digital collage** piece (Tibet-themed) selected for display—showcasing my **artistic vision** and ability to craft compelling digital designs.

### 3. Applied Problem-Solving & Technical Foundations

- **Strong STEM Preparation**

  - Embraced a rigorous math/science trajectory (including **AP Calculus AB** and **AP Physics**), enhancing my logical reasoning and **computational** thinking.
  - **AP Computer Science A** laid an early foundation in structured programming, an asset for tackling diverse coding projects later on.

- **Programming Club Involvement**

  - Served as an active member of the **school’s programming club**, where I further developed my coding skills through group challenges and personal side projects.
  - Experimented with **Python** in my spare time—writing mini-games like the **classic Snake**—honing logic, debugging techniques, and bridging concepts from my formal CS coursework.

- **Graphic & Digital Media Courses**
  - Progressed from **Graphic Design** to **Advanced Graphic Design**, mastering design principles (composition, color, typography) and professional software (Photoshop, Illustrator).
  - Completed hands-on projects in branding, digital imaging, and print layout—skills that translate well into modern tech environments requiring **UI/UX** insights.

### 4. Leadership, Teamwork & Communication

- **Event Coordination & Collaboration**

  - Worked with faculty and peers to conceptualize, iterate on, and deliver design solutions for **schoolwide** events (Art shows, Speech & Debate campaigns).
  - Presented drafts, managed deadlines, and adapted design feedback—reflecting strong **team** communication and the ability to handle real-world stakeholder expectations.

- **Art Club Participation**
  - Engaged with the **Art Club** to exchange ideas, critique peer work, and collaborate on multi-student art displays—cultivating an environment of **creative synergy**.
  - Embraced experimentation in mixed media and digital arts, reinforcing the importance of **iterative design** and open-minded brainstorming, which align with agile processes.

## Personal Passion: Coding Beyond the Classroom

I remember my **alarm clock** beeping at dawn, but I was never too tired to code. Early on, I honed my skills by creating simple mobile apps—like an **anti-theft** feature for phones and mini-games to **teach children mathematics**. One of my favorite projects was a **timer-based math game**, designed to help my cousin (who disliked math) develop a love for numbers through playful competition. The app included:

- **User Registration**: Gamified setup for new users.
- **Progressive Questions**: Ranging from simple to advanced, testing quick thinking.
- **Leaderboard**: Encouraged friendly competition and higher engagement.

Seeing my cousin’s excitement—and the resulting improvement in his math grades—reinforced how **programming** can uplift and inspire. This experience, combined with my high school’s **AP Computer Science** curriculum and **programming club** environment, fueled my belief that code is as much a **creative medium** as any form of art.

## Personal Growth & Reflection

- **Technical & Creative Synergy**

  - Fusing code logic with imaginative interfaces taught me how **user experience** and **practical function** go hand in hand.
  - Exploring mini-projects like **tilt-based games** or math-focused apps sharpened my ability to transform abstract concepts into user-friendly designs.

- **From Idea to Impact**
  - Witnessing how a small app drastically changed my cousin’s perception of math validated my conviction that technology can spark personal growth and **real-world** impact.
  - This ethos—building solutions that **engage** and **motivate**—continues to guide my approach in all subsequent projects.
