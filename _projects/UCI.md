## Overview

While at the **University of California, Irvine (UCI)**, I undertook a **double major** in **Informatics** and **Computer Science**, earned a **Minor in Statistics**, graduated **cum laude** (_3.938 GPA_), and specialized in both **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Intelligent Systems**. This rigorous path immersed me in **software development**, **user-centric design**, **data analytics**, and **cutting-edge AI**.

Across countless courses and high-impact group projects, I built systems from **low-level architecture** up to **front-end design**. I learned to dissect user needs, design robust software architectures, and manage entire development lifecycles—experiences that translate seamlessly into **app development** and beyond.

Below is a more detailed breakdown of how UCI’s demanding curriculum and research-practice environment polished my **technical depth**, **creative problem-solving**, and **team leadership** skills.

<br>

## Project & Course Highlights

### 1. Foundations in Software & Systems

- **Comprehensive Programming Mastery**

  - Enrolled in sequences like **I&C SCI 31–33** (intro, libraries, intermediate programming), plus **I&C SCI 45C** (C/C++) and **I&C SCI 45J** (Java).
  - Broke down complex problems using **object-oriented**, **functional**, and **modular** approaches—essentials for building scalable apps on **iOS**, **Android**, or any cross-platform framework.

- **Core System Design**
  - **I&C SCI 51** (Intro Computer Organization) & **I&C SCI 53** (Principles in System Design) taught me how an app’s performance depends on everything from CPU instructions, memory management, concurrency, to network protocols. This systemic insight ensures that any **mobile** or **desktop** solution I build is efficient and resilient.

### 2. Human-Centered Design & Front-End Development

- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**

  - **IN4MATX 131** (Human Computer Interaction) & **IN4MATX 133** (User Interaction Software) refined my ability to **prototype UIs**, run **usability tests**, and apply **UX heuristics**. I learned that top-tier front-ends must be both **visually appealing** and **intuitively navigable**.

- **End-to-End UI Projects**
  - **IN4MATX 134** (Project in User Interaction Software) demanded the entire cycle: brainstorming, wireframing, coding interactive UIs, and evaluating real user feedback. Managing multiple iterations gave me a practical knack for **agile**, **test-driven**, and **user-focused** development—paramount in building robust **mobile apps**.

### 3. Advanced AI & Intelligent Systems

- **Machine Learning & Data Science**

  - **COMPSCI 178** (Machine/Data Mining) and **COMPSCI 179** (Graphical Models) honed my capacity to craft **predictive** or **recommendation** algorithms, essential for building **smart** or **data-informed** features in any sophisticated application.

- **Practical AI Projects**
  - **COMPSCI 175** (Project in AI) and **COMPSCI 125** (Next Generation Search Systems) gave me hands-on experience integrating **AI** modules into functional prototypes—achieving everything from advanced text search to domain-specific reasoning. This parallels how an **app developer** can embed intelligence (like in-app chatbots or automated workflows) into consumer or enterprise apps.

### 4. Full Lifecycle Software Engineering

- **Requirements & Software Design**

  - **IN4MATX 43** and **IN4MATX 113** sharpened my approach to **requirements gathering**, stakeholder interviews, and domain-driven design. These courses stressed **version control**, **testing**, and **continuous integration**—the same practices that keep app releases stable and timely.

- **Enterprise Workflow & Team Management**
  - With **IN4MATX 151** (Project Management), I explored daily stand-ups, sprint planning, backlog grooming, and cross-functional communication—mirroring real, agile **dev team** environments. In **IN4MATX 161** (Social Analysis of Computing), I learned to account for **organizational structures** and **social impacts**—vital considerations for ethically mindful development.

### 5. Capstone & High-Impact Team Projects

- **Senior Design Projects (IN4MATX 191A & 191B)**
  - Collaborated on multi-quarter, **client-driven** software solutions. We handled everything from code architecture, iterative testing, user acceptance, to final rollouts—precisely the end-to-end app lifecycle that industry demands.
  - Took on leadership tasks such as sprint scheduling, inter-team communication, and final presentations—bolstering my project management and stakeholder engagement skills.

## My Additional Responsibilities & Skills

- **Leadership & Communication**

  - Coordinated cross-disciplinary teams (including designers, product owners, and business analysts), bridging technical complexity with plain-language explanations.
  - Spearheaded design reviews, code walk-throughs, and user research sessions—experience now fueling my ability to be **both** a strong communicator and an effective coder in any **app dev** scenario.

- **Statistical & Data-Driven Mindset**

  - A **Statistics Minor** brought me advanced courses (STATS 110, 111, 120A–C) on **experimental design**, **hypothesis testing**, and **regression modeling**—perfect for **A/B testing** new features, analyzing user data, or optimizing app performance.

- **Technical Writing & Documentation**
  - I&C SCI 139W (Critical Writing on Info Tech) trained me to produce thorough **engineering specs**, proposals, and user documentation. In real dev teams, precise documentation streamlines collaboration and ensures consistent code standards.

<br>

## Key Outcomes & Reflection

- **Versatile Developer**: I can tackle **front-end** UI challenges, **back-end** data handling, or **AI** enhancements—bridging multiple layers of any software or app ecosystem.
- **Adaptable Problem-Solver**: My curriculum at UCI was intentionally broad; I can rapidly adopt new frameworks, languages, or design paradigms—vital in the fast-evolving **mobile development** landscape.
- **Team Player & Leader**: From two-quarter capstones to smaller group projects, I repeatedly took on roles like scrum master, lead coder, or liaison with external stakeholders—equipping me with the interpersonal dexterity prized by modern dev shops.

<br>

## Personal Growth & Future Directions

1. **Deeper Innovations in App Development**

   - I often incorporate **AI** or **data insights** into user-centric solutions. The synergy of **machine learning** with **clean interface** design can yield game-changing apps.

2. **Focus on High-Impact Software**

   - Building cross-platform apps that truly improve user workflows—e.g., healthcare informatics or large-scale consumer platforms—remains a guiding passion, shaped by my experiences with real-world project constraints in courses like **IN4MATX 172** (Project in Health Informatics).

3. **Continuous Learning & Leadership**
   - My coursework demanded constant iteration as new technologies, tools, and standards emerged. I remain committed to **lifelong** upskilling and **community-driven** development principles, ensuring the solutions I create are both **scalable** and **forward-thinking**.

## Final Thoughts

UCI’s **dual-major** curriculum, grounded in **Informatics** and **Computer Science**, plus my **Statistics minor**, gave me robust **technical expertise** and a knack for **design thinking**. I’ve experienced the full scope of **software engineering**: from **conceptual design** and **requirements analysis** to **machine-learning integration** and **product deployment**. This multifaceted training underlies the **high-quality, user-driven apps** and systems I build—and fuels my excitement to keep pushing the boundaries of what technology can do.

I welcome the chance to bring this **deep coding** background, **team leadership**, and **interdisciplinary approach** to any new challenge, whether it’s **native mobile app** architecture, web-based solutions, or data-driven AI expansions.
