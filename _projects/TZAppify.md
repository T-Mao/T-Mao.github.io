## Overview

**TZAppify** is my one-person indie studio focused on crafting **beautiful, data-driven mobile experiences** that solve everyday problems. Since **January 2024**, I have solo-ideated, designed, coded, and shipped **8 SwiftUI apps** to the App Store—three of which broke into their category’s top-200 within 10 days of launch.

## Fast Facts

| Metric                       | Value                                              |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Apps shipped (100 % SwiftUI) | **8**                                              |
| Flagship ranking             | **#18** Productivity <sub>(DoneTodo)</sub>         |
| 7-day retention lift         | **+23 %** after analytics-driven onboarding tweaks |
| CI / CD pipeline             | **1-click** Fastlane → TestFlight → notarization   |

## Key Achievements

- **Repeatable Product–Market Fit** — After **DoneTodo**’s success (#18 Productivity), follow-up titles **SparkDays** (#112 Lifestyle) and **WayLater** (#169 Lifestyle) proved the studio’s ability to spot gaps, prototype fast, and attract users organically.
- **Modular Codebase** — Built a set of **Swift packages** (Core Data + iCloud sync, analytics helpers, undo/redo engine) that cut release effort by \~80 % across new apps.
- **Data-Driven Growth** — Instrumented **Firebase Analytics** + custom events; iterated on onboarding to raise D7 retention by **23 %**.
- **End-to-End Ownership** — Handle everything from Figma mock-ups and SwiftUI animations to App Store metadata, ASO, and promo videos.

## Technology Stack

- **Languages:** Swift & SwiftUI (100 % native)
- **Architecture:** MVVM + Combine, reusable Swift package modules
- **Persistence:** Core Data + iCloud / UserDefaults JSON
- **Analytics:** Firebase + custom event wrappers
- **CI/CD:** Fastlane ▸ GitHub Actions ▸ TestFlight ▸ notarization
- **Design:** Figma, SF Symbols, custom Lottie animations
- **ASO & Launch:** App Store Connect, Apple Search Ads experiments, localized screenshots in 2 languages

<br>

## Workflow

1. **Ideate** — Identify a pain-point, sketch user journeys in Figma.
2. **Prototype** — Build a proof-of-concept in SwiftUI within 48 h.
3. **Iterate** — Ship TestFlight builds, gather analytics & qualitative feedback.
4. **Polish & Launch** — Tighten animations, localize, submit to App Store.
5. **Grow** — Track retention & funnel metrics, release weekly updates.

## What’s Next

I’m expanding TZAppify’s toolkit—exploring **Swift Data**, **Swift Concurrency diagnostics**, and **watchOS companions**—while keeping the same obsession with **delightful UX** and **measurable impact**. If you’re interested in collaborations, feature ideas, or simply want to chat indie development, **let’s connect!**
