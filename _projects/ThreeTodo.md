## ThreeTodo App - Simplifying Task Management

### Concept

The idea behind ThreeTodo was to create an application that reduces the complexity often associated with task management apps. ThreeTodo features three interlinked screens — Plan, Today, and Thoughts — each dedicated to a different aspect of task management. This design allows users to navigate between planning, executing, and brainstorming with simple gestures, making it highly intuitive and user-friendly.

### User Story: Simplifying Daily Task Management

**Scenario:**
Meet Alex, a busy professional who often feels overwhelmed by the complex features of traditional to-do list apps. Alex is frustrated with the common requirements to set specific dates, times, and priorities for each task, which only adds to the day's stress. What Alex needs is a straightforward app that helps keep track of daily tasks and sudden inspirations without the hassle.

**Solution:**
ThreeTodo is the perfect solution for Alex. Developed with insights from my academic background and years of practical experience, this app eliminates unnecessary complications. It embraces the philosophy that most users prefer not to navigate through multiple screens or deal with intricate settings.

<br>

#### App Functionality:

- **Three Simplified Screens:** ThreeTodo divides its functionality across three interconnected screens—Plan, Today, and Thoughts—each tailored for specific types of task management. This allows Alex to efficiently plan future tasks, track today’s to-dos, and jot down spontaneous ideas.
- **Swipe Navigation:** Instead of tapping through menus, Alex can easily swipe between screens, making the app incredibly intuitive and reducing time spent on task management.
- **One-Tap Task Addition:** The app features a prominent plus button on each screen, allowing Alex to quickly add new tasks without navigating away from the task view. This keeps everything streamlined and straightforward.
- **Visibility and Organization:** All tasks are displayed in full without being hidden or collapsed, offering a clear overview at a glance. Alex can organize thoughts into plans and move necessary actions into today’s tasks as needed.
- **Task Persistence:** Completed tasks fade to gray but remain visible, enabling Alex to build recurring daily tasks or review completed activities for a sense of accomplishment and better planning.
- **No Due Dates or Priorities:** The app removes the need to set due dates or prioritize tasks, which is ideal for Alex’s flexible and dynamic work style. It focuses on what needs to be done rather than when or in what order, aligning perfectly with Alex’s need for simplicity.

<br>

**Conclusion:**
ThreeTodo redefines task management to suit the needs of users like Alex who prefer simplicity and efficiency. By focusing on essential functionalities and removing redundant features, ThreeTodo helps users manage their daily responsibilities and spontaneous ideas with ease, making it an indispensable tool for anyone seeking a more streamlined approach to task management.

This user-centric approach not only makes ThreeTodo a valuable tool for busy professionals but also showcases the thoughtful design and user-focused philosophy behind its development.

### Key Features

- **Streamlined Navigation**: Users can swipe between the three main screens, reducing the need for tapping and opening new windows.
- **Intuitive Interaction**: Tasks can be added with a single tap on a universally recognizable plus button, and managing tasks is made simple with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Customizable Tasks**: Tasks can be edited, moved between screens, or deleted, with additional options for creating separators for better organization.

### User-Centric Design

- **Accessibility Features**: Supports both landscape and dark mode, ensuring usability across various devices and lighting conditions.
- **Minimalist Interface**: Avoids clutter by displaying all tasks at once, making it easy for users to see their entire day or project at a glance.
- **Responsive Feedback**: Tasks that are checked off fade to gray but remain visible, allowing users to track their daily achievements without losing sight of completed tasks.

<br>

### Challenges and Solutions

- **User Experience Optimization**: Focused on minimizing user inputs to enhance convenience. For example, tasks do not require due dates or priority settings, simplifying the process of task management.
- **Design Simplicity**: Achieved a balance between functionality and minimalism by carefully selecting features that add value without overwhelming the user.
