### Introduction

Hi, I’m **Tongze Mao**—a **mobile & full-stack engineer** who transforms everyday workflow pain-points into delightful, data-driven software.

I’ve shipped **8** SwiftUI apps (3 cracked the App Store top-200) under my indie studio **[TZAppify](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/TZAppify/){:target="\_blank"}**, and previously led a four-engineer team at **[SupTech](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/SupTech/){:target="\_blank"}**, cutting support workload **85 %** with 2 cross-platform Flutter apps.

- **CUM LAUDE**, B.S. **Computer Science** & **Informatics** · Minor in **Statistics** — **[UCI](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/UCI/){:target="\_blank"}** (GPA 3.94)
- Rapid-prototyping addict · Clean-UI advocate · Always learning

<br>

### Passion for Product Design & UI/UX

I’ve tested and documented improvements for over **160+** apps, fueling my obsession with **user-centric enhancements**. This continuous cycle of hands-on exploration and idea generation shapes how I:

- Rapidly learn and apply **new frameworks**
- Continuously refine **UX flows** based on user feedback
- Deliver **polished** and **impactful** mobile experiences

<br>

### Professional Experience

#### **SupTech**

As **Software Developer & Team Lead**, I directed a four-engineer team that launched SupTech’s first self-service platform: **[two cross-platform apps for consumers and field technicians](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/SupTech/){:target="\_blank"}**.

- **Ship fast, ship right** — Designed, built, and released both Flutter + Firebase apps; customer-support workload ↓ **85 %**.
- **Scalable back end** — Node.js micro-service layer + WebSocket gateway (10 k concurrent sockets, sub-150 ms latency).
- **Workflow automation** — State-machine order lifecycle + FCM push cuts dispatch SLA **70 %**; no more Excel trackers.
- **Feature depth** — Stripe Connect escrow & instant payout, geo-search (Haversine), end-to-end encrypted chat, AI repair assistant, multilingual UI.
- **Security & compliance** — RSA-2048 handshake + AES-GCM channels → **100 % PCI-DSS & SOC 2** pass.
- **CI/CD excellence** — Fastlane + GitHub Actions: commit-to-App Store **< 2 days**, crash rate **< 0.2 %**.
- **Process leadership** — Ran agile ceremonies; velocity ↑ **70 %**, 14 sprints at **98 %** on-time delivery.
- **Quality first** — Introduced TDD across a 380 k-LOC Dart monorepo → **96 %** test coverage & nightly regression matrix.

#### **TZAppify**

Under my indie studio **[TZAppify](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/TZAppify/){:target="\_blank"}**, I’ve shipped eight native iOS apps that each tackle a specific workflow pain-point **→ [View my entire App Store developer page](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/tongze-mao/id1801828453){:target="\_blank"}**.

Here are the public, live titles—organized by theme:

##### Productivity & Planning

- **[DoneTodo](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/DoneTodo/){:target="\_blank"}** — **_#18 Productivity_** ∙ Paint-your-day grid planner with undo/redo and retention analytics.
- **[SparkDays](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/SparkDays/){:target="\_blank"}** — **_#112 Lifestyle_** ∙ Habit tracker that turns streaks into reward coins for built-in store items.

##### Memory & Reflection

- **[WayLater](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/WayLater/){:target="\_blank"}** — **_#169 Lifestyle_** ∙ “Time-capsule” letters that unlock on a future date; adds photos and comment threads.
- **[Flipperly](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/Flipperly/){:target="\_blank"}** — Flashcard SRS with swipe-to-grade UX and spaced-repetition scheduling.

##### Utilities & Developer Tools

- **[3Calc](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/3Calc/){:target="\_blank"}** — Triple calculator; swipe between three independent histories.
- **[FontMate](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/FontMate/){:target="\_blank"}** — iOS font explorer that auto-generates SwiftUI code for any style.

<small>_Two additional prototypes are in soft-launch; details coming soon._</small>

### Research Endeavors

#### **Ren Lab, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**

During a summer internship, I worked on **endoscopic 3D reconstruction** for medical imaging. Read more about my **dataset engineering** and **NeRF-based** experiments in **[CUHK Research](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/CUHK/){:target="\_blank"}**.

<br>

### UCI Academic Journey

At **[UCI](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/UCI/){:target="\_blank"}**, I pursued **dual majors** in Computer Science and Informatics, plus a Statistics Minor. My studies deeply shaped my:

- **Software Engineering** fundamentals
- **HCI** and **intelligent systems** knowledge
- Project-based leadership and agile collaboration

<br>

### My Next Step

I’m currently seeking **app development opportunities**—iOS, Android, or cross-platform—where I can contribute:

- **Full-stack skill set** (front-end UI, backend logic, data analysis)
- **User-first design mindset** (responsive, intuitive interfaces)
- **Entrepreneurial spirit** (self-driven, adaptive, always learning)

…and team up with a forward-thinking environment that values **innovation** and **impact**.

<br>

### Get in Touch

I’d love to connect! Whether you’d like to:

- Discuss new app ideas or potential collaborations
- See my code or chat about my approach to **UI/UX**
- Talk about bridging **AI** and **mobile** experiences

Feel free to reach out. I’m always excited to explore what we can build together.
