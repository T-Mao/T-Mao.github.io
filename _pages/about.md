Hi, I’m **Tongze Mao**, a passionate app developer and creative tech enthusiast dedicated to crafting forward-thinking solutions that address real-life problems—especially those involving productivity and time management. I graduated **CUM LAUDE** from the University of California, Irvine, where I studied **Computer Science** and **Informatics** with a minor in **Statistics**, achieving a **3.934 GPA** and making the **Dean’s Honor List** for 9 quarters.

My fascination with **product design** and **UI/UX** runs deep. Over the years, I’ve personally purchased and explored **106 apps**, each time noting improvement ideas and new features to better understand how they solve—or fail to solve—users’ needs. This obsession with continuous learning and hands-on testing has sharpened my ability to quickly grasp new technologies, envision user-centric improvements, and deliver high-quality apps.

During my time at **SupTech**, a fast-paced startup, I led a two-person team to conceptualize, build, and launch **two new apps** from scratch in just 3 months. From front-end development and back-end server architecture to UI design and Agile project management, I took on every step of the process, including organizing sprints, setting milestones, and leading regular progress meetings with stakeholders and team members. The outcome was a complete end-to-end solution for both iOS and Android platforms—along with tutorials, user guides, and a well-documented development workflow.

Beyond app development, I’ve conducted academic research at **Ren Lab (The Chinese University of Hong Kong)**, contributing to the EndoNeRF project focused on reconstructing endoscopic procedures. This experience deepened my appreciation for complex data processing and pushed me to integrate cutting-edge techniques into my daily workflow.

My favorite personal project to date is **“DoneTodo”**, designed to help users visualize and optimize their day by tracking how they spend each hour. Building innovative tools for productivity aligns with my core goal: **to empower people through technology**—one app at a time.

**I’m currently looking for opportunities** as an app developer (iOS, Android, or cross-platform) and am excited to bring my **full-stack skill set**, **user-first design mindset**, and **entrepreneurial spirit** to a collaborative, forward-thinking team.

Feel free to reach out to learn more about my projects, see my code in action, or chat about new ideas. I’d love to hear from you.
