### Introduction

Hi, I’m **Tongze Mao**, a passionate app developer and creative tech enthusiast dedicated to building forward-thinking solutions that address real-life problems—especially those centered on **productivity** and **time management**. I love coding in my free time, delivering fully functional iOS (and sometimes cross-platform) apps that blend **beautiful design** with **robust functionality**.

- Graduated **CUM LAUDE** from the **[University of California, Irvine](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/UCI/){:target="\_blank"}**, with a **3.938 GPA**
- Specialized in **Computer Science** + **Informatics**, plus a minor in **Statistics**
- Passionate about **product design**, **UI/UX**, and **full-stack** mobile solutions

<br>

### Passion for Product Design & UI/UX

I’ve tested and documented improvements for over **100+** apps, fueling my obsession with **user-centric enhancements**. This continuous cycle of hands-on exploration and idea generation shapes how I:

- Rapidly learn and apply **new frameworks**
- Continuously refine **UX flows** based on user feedback
- Deliver **polished** and **impactful** mobile experiences

<br>

### Professional Experience

#### **SupTech**

I led the development of two mobile apps—**[SupTech Consumer & SupTech Technician](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/SupTech/){:target="\_blank"}**—using **Flutter** for iOS & Android. Tasks included:

- **Full-cycle dev**: design → coding → backend integration → release
- **Stripe** payments, real-time **location** tracking, push notifications
- **AI Chat** integration and multi-language support
- Project management and cross-team communication

<br>

### Research Endeavors

#### **Ren Lab, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**

During a summer internship, I worked on **endoscopic 3D reconstruction** for medical imaging. Read more about my **dataset engineering** and **NeRF-based** experiments in **[CUHK Research](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/CUHK/){:target="\_blank"}**.

<br>

### Personal Projects

I love bringing my own app ideas to life—**solo**. Check out my **[App Store developer page](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/tongze-mao/id1801828453){:target="\_blank"}** or see some highlights below:

- **[DoneTodo](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/DoneTodo/){:target="\_blank"}**  
  A **grid-based** iOS time-planning app with drag-to-paint scheduling, integrated analytics, and **undo/redo**.
- **[3Calc](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/3Calc/){:target="\_blank"}**  
  A multi-calculator app where each swipe leads to a separate calculator—each with its own history log.
- **[Flipperly](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/Flipperly/){:target="\_blank"}**  
  A **flashcard-based** memory app built in Swift, focusing on spaced repetition, flipping animations, and easy review tracking.

<br>

### UCI Academic Journey

At **[UCI](https://t-mao.github.io/projects/UCI/){:target="\_blank"}**, I pursued **dual majors** in Computer Science and Informatics, plus a Statistics Minor. My studies deeply shaped my:

- **Software Engineering** fundamentals
- **HCI** and **intelligent systems** knowledge
- Project-based leadership and agile collaboration

<br>

### My Next Step

I’m currently seeking **app development opportunities**—iOS, Android, or cross-platform—where I can contribute:

- **Full-stack skill set** (front-end UI, backend logic, data analysis)
- **User-first design mindset** (responsive, intuitive interfaces)
- **Entrepreneurial spirit** (self-driven, adaptive, always learning)

…and team up with a forward-thinking environment that values **innovation** and **impact**.

<br>

### Get in Touch

I’d love to connect! Whether you’d like to:

- Discuss new app ideas or potential collaborations
- See my code or chat about my approach to **UI/UX**
- Talk about bridging **AI** and **mobile** experiences

Feel free to reach out. I’m always excited to explore what we can build together.
