### Introduction

Hi, I’m **Tongze Mao**, a passionate app developer and creative tech enthusiast dedicated to crafting forward-thinking solutions that address real-life problems—especially those involving productivity and time management.

- Graduated **CUM LAUDE** from the University of California, Irvine
- Studied **Computer Science** and **Informatics**, with a minor in **Statistics**
- Achieved a **3.934 GPA** and made the **Dean’s Honor List** for 9 quarters

<br>

### Passion for Product Design & UI/UX

My fascination with **product design** and **UI/UX** runs deep. Over the years, I’ve purchased and explored **106 apps**, taking detailed notes on potential improvements. This obsession with **continuous learning** and **hands-on testing** has sharpened my ability to:

- Quickly absorb new technologies
- Propose user-centric enhancements
- Deliver high-quality, impactful apps

<br>

### Professional Experience

#### _SupTech_

At **SupTech**, a fast-paced startup, I led a two-person team to conceptualize, build, and launch **two new apps** from the ground up in just 3 months. My responsibilities spanned:

- `Front-end development` (iOS & Android)
- `Back-end server architecture`
- `UI design` and refinements
- `Agile project management` (sprints, milestones, regular progress meetings)
- Publishing with thorough `tutorials, user guides, and documentation`

<br>

### Research Endeavors

#### _Ren Lab, The Chinese University of Hong Kong_

In addition to app development, I contributed to the **EndoNeRF** project, focusing on reconstructing endoscopic procedures. This experience honed my skills in:

- **Complex data processing**
- **Innovative research techniques** for medical imaging

<br>

### Personal Projects

My favorite project so far is **“DoneTodo”**, an app designed to help users **visualize and optimize** their day by tracking hourly activities. This perfectly aligns with my core goal:

> **_Empowering people through technology—one app at a time._**

<br>

### My Next Step

I’m currently seeking **app development opportunities**—iOS, Android, or cross-platform—where I can contribute my:

- **Full-stack skill set**
- **User-first design mindset**
- **Entrepreneurial spirit**

…and collaborate with a **forward-thinking team** that values **innovation** and **impact**.
